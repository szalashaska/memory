    Memory is a simple card game. Your task is to find the matching pairs and to
    have fun while doing it! So let's have fun!
  </p>
  <p>
    To spice things up we are keeping score, while you playing. The score takes
    into account how quick you are, so try to be as fast as possible. And if you
    find pairs in consecutive order, that also will be rewarded. The best
    players will be shown in our Top Scores table. But only if they register
    first, so there is no stranger on the board.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make game even more interesting you get to choose your own theme of
    cards. Just type anything you like and we will try to find. If you do not
    feel like typing anything just use the "Quick Start" button.
  </p>

    those, who decide to register, we can save the liked photos in our account.
